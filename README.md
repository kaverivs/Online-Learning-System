# Online-Learning-System
Using Java Object Oriented Programming System (OOPS), a simple online learning system is created. 
Applied the oops concepts like class, object, abstraction, encapsulation, interface, inheritance, polymorphism.

Like all online learning systems, this “eLearning app” online learning platform has a “Login” page.
Those login credentials will differentiate the new joinees with the old ones.
For that we use certain credential checkers.
Based on those credentials like email and password, the system understands that the user is already registered or not.
After login, a home page will display.

If it is an already registered user, then navigate to corresponding homepage of that user.
Otherwise, will go to a fresh home page.

From that home page, the user will be taken to the page having the list of latest in-demand courses.
Here we calculate the discount for each course and display according to the user interested courses.
Then from those courses, they can check the details of each course and choose their favourite one.
After this, they need to enter some details for registration. 

Once after successful registration, their profile is created. 
In that profile we display all personal as well as course details.
These details are fetched from the classes like login, course and registration.
Once profile is displayed, a pop-up message will appear to start learning and the user can start watching sessions.

For already registered trainees, the home page will take them to their profile.
There they can see their personal details, current course details, courses history details, saved courses etc.
Also, the system will give notification if there are any new sessions uploaded for the particular course.
